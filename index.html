            <p>Growing up in South Florida, I've always had a bigger vision than what's around me. Day after day, I wake 
            up and see sugar cane being harvested along side other agriculture areas and thought to myself; "I want 
            to do something bigger in life."
            </p>

            <p>After taking one coding class of python, I knew this was something that I enjoy
                and could see myself doing for many years to come. If not the rest of my life. 
            </p>

            <p>My vision seems to be very far away, But this is the first step in the right direction.
